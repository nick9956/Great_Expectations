# Great Expectations Project

This project utilizes Great Expectations, an open-source data validation and documentation framework, to ensure and monitor the data quality of the `TRN` MSSQL database.

## Project Structure

- `great_expectations/`: Contains all the configurations, expectations, checkpoints, and data docs generated by Great Expectations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Great Expectations
- Access to an MSSQL database.
- Jupyter Notebook (for editing expectation suites interactively)

## Setup Instructions

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install great_expectations jupyter pyodbc
```

Navigate to the project directory where `great_expectations` is already set up.

## Usage

### Creating and Editing Expectation Suites

- **Edit an Existing Expectation Suite**:
  To modify or enhance an existing expectation suite, use the following command:
  ```bash
  great_expectations suite edit employees.warning
  ```
  This command opens a Jupyter notebook that allows you to add or modify expectations interactively.

### Building and Viewing Data Docs

- **Build Data Docs**:
  Generate documentation for your expectations and validations:
  ```bash
  great_expectations docs build
  ```

- **View Data Docs**:
  Open the `index.html` file located in `great_expectations/uncommitted/data_docs/local_site/` in any web browser to view a detailed report of your data quality validations.

### Running Checkpoints

- **Run a Checkpoint**:
  To validate your data against the defined expectations, run a checkpoint:
  ```bash
  great_expectations checkpoint run my_checkpoint
  ```

### Modifying Data

To test the robustness of your data quality checks, manually introduce errors into the `hr.employees` table and rerun the checkpoint to see how Great Expectations catches these errors.
